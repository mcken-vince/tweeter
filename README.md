# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. Built with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, AJAX on the front, and Node, Express, MongoDB on the back-end.
Designed to be responsive to different screen sizes, playing with CSS media queries, different animation options with CSS & jQuery, all the while using flexbox everywhere... and I mean everywhere.
User can compose tweets, which show up as posted by a random user. Reaction icons are purely aesthetic. No login functionality, profile div is also just for show.
